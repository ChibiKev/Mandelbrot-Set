## Intro To Computing
Project for CSC 103 - Intro To Computing with Professor William Skeith at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
In this project, you will implement a simple program to plot the famous [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). It doesn’t have much mathematical significance that I know of, but it does make pretty pictures. It also makes for good programming practice.
<br/>
Here are a few things you’ll get out of this project:
- A very brief introduction to GUI programming;
- More about classes and a very brief introduction to object oriented programming;
- Refinement of your overall coding skill.
## Additional Information
- Honestly I got no idea what happened here.
- There may still be some BUGS in the code.
- It's really laggy.
## Ask me about anything
